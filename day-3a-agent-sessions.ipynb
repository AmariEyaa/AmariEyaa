    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned in my previous answer, which was:\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Advances in Understanding Disease Biology:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a foundational area, because you can't effectively discover drugs if you don't deeply understand what's going wrong in a disease. Here's a breakdown of key advancements within this category:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **CRISPR and Gene Editing Technologies:**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a revolutionary gene-editing tool that allows scientists to precisely cut and modify DNA at specific locations.\n",
      "    *   **Impact on Drug Discovery:**\n",
      "        *   **Understanding Gene Function:** Researchers can use CRISPR to \"knock out\" or \"knock in\" specific genes in cells or animal models to see what happens. This helps determine if a gene is essential for disease development or if it's a potential target for a drug.\n",
      "        *   **Creating Disease Models:** CRISPR is instrumental in creating more accurate cell and animal models of human diseases. For example, they can engineer a mouse model to carry a specific human genetic mutation that causes a disease, allowing for more relevant drug testing.\n",
      "        *   **Therapeutic Potential Itself:** While not always traditional \"drug discovery,\" CRISPR is also being developed as a therapeutic itself – to directly edit the faulty genes responsible for genetic disorders (e.g., sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Single-Cell Omics (Genomics, Transcriptomics, Proteomics, etc.):**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** Traditionally, biological samples were analyzed in bulk, giving an average picture of what was happening across millions of cells. Single-cell omics technologies allow scientists to analyze the genetic material (DNA/RNA) or proteins of *individual cells*.\n",
      "    *   **Impact on Drug Discovery:**\n",
      "        *   **Revealing Cellular Heterogeneity:** Diseases often don't affect all cells in an organ or tissue uniformly. Single-cell analysis reveals that a particular disease might be driven by a small subpopulation of specific cell types.\n",
      "        *   **Identifying More Precise Targets:** Instead of targeting a broad pathway that affects many cell types, researchers can identify targets that are specifically active or altered in the disease-driving cells. This leads to more targeted and potentially less toxic therapies.\n",
      "        *   **Understanding Disease Progression:** By analyzing cells at different stages of a disease, scientists can map out the cellular changes that occur over time, providing crucial insights into how the disease develops and progresses. This helps identify critical intervention points.\n",
      "        *   **Biomarker Discovery:** Single-cell data can also help identify biomarkers that indicate the presence or progression of a disease, or predict how a patient might respond to a particular treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Microbiome Research:**\n",
      "    *   **What it is:** The human microbiome refers to the trillions of microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi) that live in and on our bodies, especially in the gut.\n",
      "    *   **Impact on Drug Discovery:**\n",
      "        *   **Gut-Brain Axis and Beyond:** We're learning that the microbiome influences a vast range of bodily functions, from digestion and immunity to mental health (the gut-brain axis) and even responses to cancer therapies.\n",
      "        *   **New Therapeutic Avenues:** This understanding opens up possibilities for developing:\n",
      "            *   **Probiotics and Prebiotics:** Live beneficial bacteria or substances that feed them.\n",
      "            *   **Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT):** Transferring gut bacteria from a healthy donor to a patient.\n",
      "            *   **Phage Therapy:** Using viruses that infect bacteria to target harmful microbes.\n",
      "            *   **Drugs that Modulate Microbial Metabolites:** Developing therapies that influence the chemical compounds produced by gut bacteria.\n",
      "        *   **Predicting Drug Response:** Emerging research suggests the microbiome can affect how well certain drugs work or how toxic they are. Understanding this interaction can help personalize treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In essence, these advances are giving us an unprecedented, high-resolution view of the biological underpinnings of disease. This detailed understanding is crucial for:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Identifying better, more specific drug targets.**\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n",
    "2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n",
    "3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n"
